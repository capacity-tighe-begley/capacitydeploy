# Automatically Update a CM Package with the latest Defender Defintions & Platform Updates

Much credit goes to others, who are noted in the script, I took what they had and added Platform Updates and made it my dynamic by leveraging a Package in CM.
Why?  Because it's nice during OSD to apply these so Defender if updated ASAP, even before the software updates start getting applied.
